# MasterChef
Masterchef is an application that lets you compete in the programming contests on CodeChef giving you the tools you wish.

The MasterChef application has been built on [electron](https://github.com/electron) which makes it cross-platform (Linux, Windows, MacOS) application. It has been built on plain JavaScript and hence ensures the speed and fluidity of the application.

### Install MasterChef

MasterChef can be either used directly by the `release-builds` or it can be manually installed. To install manually, nodeJS must be installed on the user's system.

First clone the repository to your local environment:

```
git clone https://bhushan_@bitbucket.org/bhushan_/masterchef.git
```

Next move into the repository:

```
cd masterchef
```

Further to install dependencies and running the application use:

```
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the application
npm start
```

The `release-builds` folder consists of the folders dedicated each of the operating systems. The corresponding folder can be downloaded to the system and the executable file can be ran to launch the application.

### About

The MasterChef application was built as a part of the CodeChef API Hackathon powered by Alibaba cloud. I would like to thank [CodeChef](https://codechef.com) for providing its API service for us to build such awesome apps. I would also like to thank [Alibaba Cloud](https://www.alibabacloud.com) for providing their cloud services for free during this period.
